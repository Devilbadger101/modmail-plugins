# Raw 
Raw is a plugin that fetches the contents of an embedded message received or sent by the bot, particularly useful for mobile users.

This plugin is based on [Andy's previous version](https://github.com/matrix2113/modmail-plugins/tree/master/raw) and has improved upon some errors found in that previous code.
